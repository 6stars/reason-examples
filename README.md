# Reason Data Structures

**HEY!**, I've moved the sorting algorithms that were here to [reason-sorting-algorithms](https://github.com/JakeDawkins/reason-sorting-algorithms). Check it! 💯

This is just a project I'm working on showcasing some basic data structures in Reason. Spoiler: some of them are _very_ slim wrappers around existing reason modules.

Feel free to play around with whatever you want though 👍. Hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jakedawkins) if you'd like.

**Side Note**: I built this using bucklescript and `bs-platform` because I can't get the reason cli installed on my computer at the moment (path too long. thanks nvm).
